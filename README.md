# Work Plan

## Objectives
1.	Apply Data Scrapping Libraries to scrape data (‘squad stats’) from https://fbref.com/en/comps/1/possession/World-Cup-Stats..
2.	Apply Data Manipulation and Analysis Libraries to modify and analyze data.
3.	Apply Data Visualization Library to create plots to assist in Analysis.

## Project Goal
The goal is to perform a comparative analysis of FIFA World Cup 2022 squads based on their possession statistics using different methods to answer the following through visualization:

a.	Compare the best teams from the continents using a bar chart.

b.	Compare the best attack teams from the continents using a bar chart.

c.	Compare the best defense teams from the continents using a bar chart.

d.	Compare the best midfield teams from the continents using a bar chart.

e.	Compare the 2 finalists (Argentina, and France) of the FIFA world cup using radar chart based on “Touches” related attributes (i.e. Touches, Def Pen, Def 3rd, Mid 3rd, Att 3rd, Att Pen, Live). Which team is better?

f.	Compare the 2 finalists (Argentina, and France) of the FIFA world cup using radar chart based on “Take-Ons” related attributes (i.e. Att, Succ, Succ%, Tkld, Tkld%). Which team is better?

g.	Compare the 2 finalists (Argentina, and France) of the FIFA world cup using radar chart based on “Carries” related attributes (i.e. Carries, TotDist, PrgDist, PrgC, 1/3, CPA, Mis, Dis). Which team is better?

h.	Combine the results from question e-g and comment on which team is better overall.
